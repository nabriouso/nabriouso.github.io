            Minecraft has changed a lot since its initial beta period in 2011.
            The game has grown substantially, and new features, mechanics and
            systems continue to be added even to this day. While this is all
            well and good, there are still players out there who don't enjoy the
            direction the game took post-release, or simply have nostalgia for
            beta minecraft and wish to return to a time without hunger,
            experience or enchantments with a few bells and whistles on. Better
            Than Adventure is designed to appeal to these players who enjoy the
            simpler gameplay of the old beta versions of Minecraft, yet also
            want to try something new and exciting. Think of it as an "alternate
            universe" version of minecraft that attempts to maintain the
            look-and-feel of beta 1.7.3, while also keeping things fresh with
            new features and additions such as new blocks, biomes and quality of
            life improvements. Despite what the name implies, this mod isn't
            necessarily trying to offer something inherently better than modern
            Minecraft, just something different. Think of it as a long-lost
            branch of Minecraft, what could have been if Notch and Jeb took the
            game in a slightly different direction. While BTA is designed mostly
            to appeal to older players who grew up with beta, the aim of the mod
            in general is simply to offer an alterate take on the game. So if
            you're just looking for something new to enjoy, try this mod out
            too. You may like it!

            "Better Than Adventure" (BTA) is an extensive mod for Minecraft beta
            1.7.3, bringing out regular updates attempting to create a more
            "finalized" version of beta Minecraft while also maintaining the
            look and feel of the game pre-adventure update. BTA works very
            different from other mods as it acts as more of a “fork” of
            Minecraft, than an addition to it. As of beta 1.7.6, As such,
            existing mods for beta 1.7.3 are not compatible with BTA. However,
            we are working hard to allow the community to make and publish their
            own mods for BTA specifically.

          Minecraft worlds now cycle through 4 seasons, over a span of 28 days
          (7 days per season). These seasons provide an interesting spin on
          survival gameplay; as the seasons change and winter begins to fall,
          the game will become progressively more challenging. Crops start to
          grow less often, mobs spawn more frequently, and the nights will
          become longer. It is important you plan around the changing seasons,
          stocking up on resources to survive the cold winter

          The iconic beta world generation has also been given a major touch-up
          in BTA. First and foremost, the sea-level has been risen to 128, which
          means 128 blocks of underground, and 128 blocks of overworld. This
          also means mountains can grow to twice the size they could than
          before, leading to even wackier terrain than normal.
        </div>
        <div class="text-xs mb-1">
          Biomes have been changed too, they now generate at around twice the
          size they used to, meaning no more ugly micro-deserts. Existing biomes
          have also been touched up to make them more unique, for example,
          swamplands now spawn with fields of algae and mossy trees, and
          seasonal forests spawn groves of cherry trees that shine a bright pink
          in the spring.

                One thing that beta 1.7.3 and below did lack was a functioning
                creative mode where you can test out contraptions and plan
                builds in a world with infinite blocks and health. This has been
                added to BTA, however its not just a simple port of beta 1.8's
                creative mode. We thought we'd try and improve on it by adding
                better flying controls, a more readable creative inventory, and
                a list of single player commands.

                many more blocks to expand your building capabilities with. As
                well as that, BTA also adds new blocks for Redstone
                contraptions, such as retractable 'spike traps' that damage mobs
                when stepped on, 'motion sensors' that activate when mobs move

                Because we understand that sometimes recipes can be difficult to

                of the recipes found in the game. However, this book works a

                It also offers as a completion objective for players who wish to
                fill out the book completely and “craft 'em all”. (But
                alternatively if you just want to see the new recipes for

              Welcome! Better than Adventure is a mod for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3.
              It was originally intended to add a few new features for a
              personalised experience, but has since grown into a full-fledged
              fork of Minecraft, adding dozens of new features for players to
              enjoy. Our philosophy is to add new gameplay that enhances and
              improves on the existing aspects of the game, without drastically
              changing the core experience. The question we like to ask
              ourselves is, "Would Mojang have added this to the vanilla game
              back in 2011?" If the answer is yes, it's probably a good
              candidate for BTA

              The recommended method of playing BTA is via our handy MultiMC
              update utility, which you can find <a href="#">here</a>! To
              install the utility, simply drag and drop that link onto your
              MultiMC instance list, then run it. It'll generate a managed
              instance of BTA, which you can then run to launch the mod. The
              neat part is, whenever the mod releases a new update you can just
              run the update utility again and it'll automatically upgrade your
              managed instance to the latest version! No more messing around
              with jar files, and all your saves, screenshots and settings will
              be in exactly the same place

              Lots of things! We've added so much new stuff to this mod that
              it's honestly impossible to keep track of it all. A good place to
              start if you want to know everything is our
              <a href="#">update changlog</a>. However, an experience we find a
              lot of people seem to enjoy is just going in blind and discovering
              new stuff as you play. We're always happy to answer any questions
              you might have on <a href="#">our Discord server</a>, so feel free
              to join and ask! There's also a recipe book called the Guidebook
              built into the game, which is bound to R by default. Recipes start
              blacked out, but progressively reveal themselves as you discover
              the items that comprise them. Don't be afraid to experiment!

            <div class="mb-1">
              Thanks for the interest! There's a few ways you can help with BTA:
              firstly, if you're a programmer, feel free to ask us about
              becoming a contributor on our <a href="#">Discord</a>, as we're
              always eager to get new people with different abilities and
              skillsets involved with development. Just be aware that the
              standards expected are pretty high, so we'll need to see some
              evidence of your ability before giving you access.
            </div>
            <div class="mb-1">
              Secondly, if you're a texture artist, stick around! We pretty
              frequently ask the community for new textures, since there's a lot
              of talented people out there who can make far better art than we
              can. Thirdly, post suggestions in suggestion-discussion! We're
              always looking for new ideas to make the mod better. If none of
              those things apply, spread the word! Tell your friends, partners,
              coworkers, or even strangers on the street about BTA. After all,
              the more the merrier!

          <div class="text-xs">
            <div class="mb-1">
              Yes and no - BTA is only compatible with mods specifically made
              for it. Most mods you can think of will not work, as a lot of our
              optimizations means we have had to change/rewrite way too much of
              the codebase for anything else to be compatible. This means that
              until someone miraculously ports it over, you won't be able to
              play BTA with Aether, or BTA with Moon Mod, so on and so forth.

              You can! The recipe is just a little different. In BTA, zombies
              drop cloth rather than feathers. The bed recipe requires 2 cloth
              and 1 wool, rather than 3 wool, like below:

          <div class="text-xs">
            <div class="mb-1">
              Yes, we could if we wanted to, but that's not really our
              philosophy. If there's a feature from a later version we'd like to
              include in BTA, we ask ourselves how we can reinvent that feature
              in a way that still gets us there while also giving players a new
              experience.
            </div>
            <div class="mb-1">
              For example, modern Minecraft features multiple different
              varieties of wooden planks, and so does BTA. However, in BTA ours
              come from giving the player the ability to dye oak planks, which
              gives them a fun new pastel color palette to play with.
